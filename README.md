# ValorantEvent
Fun event of the game **VALORANT**. *(NOT AFFILIATED WITH VALORANT OR RIOT)*

## Concept

Teams can register themselfs on a discord server (WIP) and when they play in the tournament they get challenges.
If a team successfully passes a challenge, it gets one point. 
If a team wins the round it only gets an additional point if the team passed the challenge.

## Challenges

There are different types of challenges:
 - Match challenge: You may pass these challenges the whole game. (e.g. only use 5 explicit agents)
 - Round challenge: You may pass these challenges in one round. (e.g. only walk backwards)

## Information

This event will be livestreamed on https://twitch.tv/DerBanko.
The first events will only be in german (to test it out).
Consider joining the Discord Server: *WIP*
